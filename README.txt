# Harmonic Beds for Bayes Inversion

_This Project is in active development_


----
__To Do __:

  - [ ] Rerun $\Delta \dot b$ grid search on 100 $\rm{m}$ grid on WestGrid
    - Probably will need to decrease the time-step to 1 $\rm{y}$ for numerical
      stability/convergence since the grid spacing was refined.
