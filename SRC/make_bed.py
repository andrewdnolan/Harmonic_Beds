"""
Need to make a "raw bed" .dat file which is the starting point for this script.
    Can be written here or somewhere else.

Then, add command line functionality to pass bed smoothing or noise parameters

    For example, smooth the raw bed with Savgol filter but allow for different
    polynomial orders and window sizes

Once, Alexi has decided how to add noise via fourier analysis to our beds,
then it would be good to have the functionality within here as well.
